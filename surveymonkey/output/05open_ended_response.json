It's quite effective, especially because many people think about it but just a few actually do something about it.

What I can see from the assignments and quiz is that interpreting a question has important implications for how to write a SQL query. If there is one area where I would like more practice with (relating to writing SQL queries), then it would be to have a few guided walkthroughs of the multiple ways of interpreting a business question and whether one or more of these interpretations would be incorrect. When we work through practice writing SQL queries, we can look at the sample output (first few rows) and tell if our interpretation is not the same as what was intended in the business question. But if the question is interpreted differently, then is it that interpretation incorrect? This becomes more of a concern when the sample output is not provided and we have to make a judgement as to how to go forward with our constructing a SQL query. Are there any best practices we should follow? Maybe any conventions which will help us better interpret a slightly ambiguous business question? Walkthroughs focused on the interpretation of the question would be useful, I think."}

{"rid": "12755664534", "qid": "661036416", "text": "I think the lectures need more preparation because there's a lot of 'downtime' when demo's don't work. Even when they do work, it's not very substantial and it shows us maybe 50-60% of how things work. For example, the github lecture was a rather chaotic and a lot of questions that came up were unanswered.\r\n\r\nI think the lectures can be modified so that for each concept we cover, it is immediately followed by a quick demo. And perhaps in the end, all the concepts can be tied together into a real working demo that doesn't have to be too complex but also not trivial. I felt this would have been helpful for the Snowflake and Airflow lectures because we weren't shown a real working example in either of those two cases.\r\n\r\nFinally, I appreciate the attempts to make the content 'interactive' but it shouldn't come at the expense of really showing us why the tools we're learning about are useful and important. I understand it's hard to gauge how much we're comprehending when there's minimal feedback through the zoom lecture format. I think it would help the organization of the lectures if you broke up the lecture time into 5-6 'chunks' of 25-30 mins each. In each chunk, you can develop one really important set of concepts, introduce what you are trying to show, why it's important and follow up with a brief demo. The questions and interactivity will naturally come from us at that point. A good illustration of this is the May 1st lecture with Edwin on EMR/pySpark and the March 24th lecture with Shaohua on the overview of data pipelines."}

To be very honest, I did not know how likely I would be able to get into one, given I was largely unprepared at the time of application. If I do end up getting an offer, then the above answer will change, leaning towards working longer on client projects. I would like to work on client projects even when I am in school to maximize my chance of landing a job afterward. \r\nIf I end up not getting in (which as time passes, is leaning towards this case), my fallback option would be to apply for an Open Work Permit that is valid for three years. I am eligible for that as part of the newest scheme targeted for Hong Kong residents who graduated in the last five years. The catch is, given COVID-19, I will need a job offer to be able to enter Canada. The restrictions should loosen up with time, depending on Canada's vaccination rate. I hope, come fall, the permit holder will be allowed to look for jobs after entering the country. One more thing to note is that, with a year of work experience, the permit holder will have a pathway for permanent residency. If I do end up in this second, unfortunate situation, I will be in a situation where I need to start applying for jobs sooner rather than later."}

{"rid": "12491601000", "qid": "624657616", "text": "I had some general notes on the lecture style, now that we've had a chance to experience lectures with both Preetika and Edwin.\r\n\r\nFirstly, a logistical issue -- I feel we can schedule the break around the mid-lecture mark, after 1.5 hours. That way, it will be a more balanced distribution of the time. We've also experimented with posting questions on the slack channel, the zoom chat, and just unmuting our microphone. I think it's best to just ask everyone to say their question as this makes the lecture more integrated. Afterwards, there's no need to scroll through the slack to find the question or try to remember what a question was when it is answered in the lecture.\r\n\r\nSecond, with Edwin, I find the lectures really useful but sometimes the concepts can 'bleed' into one another. So he will start talking about one concept and then go into a tangent to explain what is going on in response to a question. This is good, however, I think it is important to then take a minute to re-orient everyone on what we were discussing and how everything ties together into a 'chunk'. Each lecture can then consist of multiple such chunks. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important when we are jumping between multiple screens with the code, the diagramming (whiteboard), and the lecture content. It is important to then bring everyone onto the same page every 10-15 minutes. This also makes it easier to refer back to concepts in the recorded lectures. Otherwise, currently, even looking at the recorded lectures with multiple rewinds and pauses, it is rather hard to follow.\r\n\r\nThirdly, with Preetika, I think she does a very good job of going over the concepts and placing those strategic pauses to make sure everyone is on the same page. However, the concepts covered are mainly through the slides which makes it difficult to make them concrete. For example, in the cloud lecture, we were discussing \"direct connects\" for transfers to the cloud. Is this something we only need a passing familiarity with or is this a critical issue that we need to learn in more detail? This needs to be clarified in the lectures, otherwise, we are only learning a lot of definitions and the actual practice/implementation is isolated from the theory.\r\n\r\nFinally, I thought Shaohua's review lecture on Saturday provided a very good balance between taking the time to lay out the theory and actually working through the exercises to show the implementation. We could ask questions during the lecture and it helped cement the particularities of what we were learning while also making sure we have the bigger picture, the 'why'."}
